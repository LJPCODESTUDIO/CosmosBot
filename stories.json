He had been so drunk the night before that she could not have dissuaded him from spending the night. Instead of the usual caresses, he had been unable to keep his hands off her. She was still entertaining thoughts of him.\nShe supposed she had always had some feelings for him. It was more than those. No, it was not attraction. It was something far more profound. Sexuality, yes, but it was not just that. It was a connection. A telepathy of sorts. She felt him in a way that she had never before. He had never felt this way about her.\nShe found herself wondering if he felt the same about her. There was no way to know for sure. That was part of what made it even more confusing. He had been so polite and caring. He had been so loving. But she could not deny the feelings she had experienced.\nHer interest in him was not solely sexual. She could not help but feel drawn to him. It was most interesting.\nThere was more to it than the little that she had managed to experience. The way he looked at her, the way he touched her... She did not know what to make of it.\nWhat was it that made her feel like this?\nShe closed her eyes and then opened them, wondering if she had somehow been sent into a trance. Nothing of the sort had happened. She was simply pondering the situation. Had there been anything at all between them? Or was it just an unpredented combination of lust and attraction? She didn't know, and she wasn't sure she wanted to know. She would have to live these feelings for some time yet.\n***\nStaring at the ceiling, Jason turned his head to the right, seeing Tiffany sitting on the edge of the bed, tears streaming down her face. She wasn't sobbing, but it wasn't hard to see she had been upset. He sat up, his face contorted with concern.\n\"What's wrong?\"\nTiffany turned and looked at him. \"You have to help me,\" she said.\nThat struck fear into him. \"What do you need me to do?\"\nShe hesitated, but then reached into the pants pocket where she kept her keys. She pulled out a small case. \"I have to go out,\" she said, handing it to him.\n\"What?\" he asked. \"Where are you going?\"\n\"I have to take this.\" She paused, as if to think about it, but then went on. \"I can't tell you.\"\n\"Ah, it's one of those drugs, isn't it?\" he asked.\n\"Yes. No. I can't tell you that. Please.\" She reached out and put her hand on his chest, trying to keep him from moving.\n\"Tiffany,\" Jason said. \"I'm sorry, but you know you can trust me.\"\n\"There's something you need to know,\" Tiffany said. \"I used to take a drug to help me sleep. It wasn't that I couldn't sleep. It was just that I would dream really vividly. They always had to do with sex. I'm not sure of the reason.\"\n\"Is it the same stuff you're taking now?\"\n\"No. And I don't know what to tell you about that. It wasn't like this, and it's not like this now.\"\nJason glanced to the side. Lorelei was gone. He didn't know where she had gone, but at",

He also knew she was correct. \"It was a gamble to give her a choice, and I lost. I feel bad about it.\"\n\"Well, you shouldn't,\" Lainie huffed.\nIt made Alfred uneasy. Too many things were bothering him. He knew that if he didn't get some rest, he might go mad. \"What I wouldn't give to see things my way for a day,\" he muttered. \"I'd party and I'd celebrate life.\"\n\"I can do that for you. Just name the day and the party.\"\n\"Today, maybe? I need to get to bed, but I could use a drink first,\" Alfred said.\n\"Oh, I can make that happen, too. Come. Let me get you a drink.\"\n***\nAlice and Zerena helped each other stagger through the door, both not certain they'd be able to make it across the threshold even if they wanted to.\n\"You can't just leave me here,\" Zerena pouted.\nThe \"not sure\" bit was an order. Alice didn't want to set the limit any lower.\nBut they'd been invited. Their presence was expected.\nThey were going to be there.\n***\nAndreyko and Shaw weren't the only ones in the lounge when they arrived.\n\"He's right behind me,\" Zerena said, spotting the shadowy figure in the dark. \"Isn't he?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Alice said.\n\"He is, but he'll never see us,\" Zerena said. \"I have his eyes.\"\nAlice had no doubt Zerena was right. \"The others might be in there,\" Alice said, \"but I'm not quite sure you should take the risk. I mean, you could be caught out there and killed.\"\n\"I don't care,\" Zerena said. \"Alfred is supposed to be here, and he didn't show.\"\n\"He's probably got a reason for it,\" Alice said. \"Maybe he's sick or injured or something.\"\n\"Again, I don't care,\" Zerena said. \"He's been a cohort of yours. He should be present for this as well.\"\n\"All of this just to help a woman who's just as likely to betray us? I'm not sure I'm convinced,\" Alice said.\n\"I'm not,\" Zerena agreed. \"But it isn't about whether we go or not. It's about getting him here. If we can't do that, we can't do what we came to do anyway. He's got his reasons, and so do we.\"\n\"Might as well get it over with,\" Alice said, giving up.\n***\n\"Excellent spirits,\" Andreyko said, taking a sip of his drink. \"Some of the best I've ever tasted.\"\n\"I'll say,\" Shaw said, taking a sip.\n\"Well, let's not delay the party any longer,\" Andreyko said. \"I've spoken with the Countess, and I've arranged a feast. Let's get this party started!\"\n***\nDr. Andreyko was one of the more physically attractive people Alice had seen since waking up as a wight.\nAndreyko himself seemed to run on a higher plane of existence than most people. He was tall, with strawberry-blond hair, a beard, and large blue eyes. That was just the usual Viking stuff, though.\nThe real difference was how Andreyko interacted with people, especially those he held dear. And that was all because of a key item in his possession\u2014a book.\nAlice recalled that book from her German History 101 course. It was the Book of Enoch.\n\"My earliest memory is that book falling from a shelf and breaking into a thousand pieces in front of my eyes,\" Andreyko said. \"I always thought that was a sign from God. I moved to Stockholm, became a doctor and a teacher, but when I met my wife, she convinced me that it was the right thing to become a priest.\"\n\"And you liked that, right?\" Zerena asked.\n\"It's a humbling job,\" Andreyko said. \"Being a priest is really about being a servant to others. It's about serving them until they can do",
